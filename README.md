# Established remote companies

A curated list of established remote/distributed/virtual tech companies. The criteria for inclusion are intentionally vague, but the general idea is to include only established tech companies for which a significant portion of the workforce works remotely. *Established* means that each company is either well-funded or profitable, and *tech* means that they have more than a handful of software development roles.

Pull requests are welcome. Please keep the list in alphabetical order.

Notes:
* *Web* covers the usual front-end skills, *Mobile* usually means iOS and Android, and *DevOps* is listed for companies where this is one of the main focus areas.
* Globally-competitive compensation means that the company doesn't use remote workers as a source of cheap labour. For compensation to be globally competitive, the company should offer packages that are comparable to market rates in major tech hubs.
