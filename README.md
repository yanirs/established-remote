# Established remote companies (hiring globally)

A curated list of established remote/distributed/virtual tech companies. The general idea is to include only established tech companies for which a significant portion of the workforce works remotely. *Established* means that each company is either well-funded or profitable with at least 50 employees, and *tech* means that they have more than a handful of software development roles. To make this list more useful to a global audience, companies that limit their hiring of engineers to a small set of [rich countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) are no longer included.

Pull requests are welcome. Please keep the list in alphabetical order.

**Background:** I started this list back in 2015 as a way of finding companies I may want to work with. This turned out well, as I've been working remotely as a data scientist since 2017. With remote work becoming mainstream since 2020, I've narrowed this list to focus on companies that hire globally. You can [visit my website](https://yanirseroussi.com/) to read some of [my reflections on remote data science](https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/11/03/reflections-on-remote-data-science-work/). You can also check out [this video of a talk I gave on a day in the life of a remote data scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qbVEEtgWcY). TL;DR: Remote work is awesome! :)

Notes:
* *Web* covers the usual front-end skills, *Mobile* usually means iOS and Android, and *DevOps* is listed for companies where this is one of the main focus areas.
* Globally-competitive compensation means that the company doesn't use remote workers as a source of cheap labour. For compensation to be globally competitive, the company should offer packages that are comparable to market rates in major tech hubs.
* **[✉️ You can subscribe to job alerts by companies from this list on Job Dispatch](https://www.jobdispatch.co/job-collections/remote-first)**.
