# Established remote companies

A curated list of established remote/distributed/virtual tech companies. The criteria for inclusion are intentionally vague, but the general idea is to include only established tech companies for which a significant portion of the workforce works remotely. *Established* means that each company is either well-funded or profitable, and *tech* means that they have more than a handful of software development roles.

*Updates to inclusion criteria:*
 * 2019-02: To make things a bit less vague and avoid ending up with a huge list, I stopped adding companies that have fewer than 50 employees. I will also remove small companies from the list at some stage.
 * 2020-04: To make this list more useful to a global audience, companies that don't hire engineers across multiple timezone regions are no longer included. The timezone regions are roughly: Americas, Europe-Africa, and Asia-Pacific.

Pull requests are welcome. Please keep the list in alphabetical order.

**Note:** I started this list as a way of finding companies I may want to work with. These days, I work as a remote data scientist with Automattic. You can [visit my website](https://yanirseroussi.com/) to read about [my application path](https://yanirseroussi.com/2017/07/29/my-10-step-path-to-becoming-a-remote-data-scientist-with-automattic/) and [my thoughts on the experience so far](https://yanirseroussi.com/2018/11/03/reflections-on-remote-data-science-work/). You can also check out [this video of a talk I gave on a day in the life of a remote data scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qbVEEtgWcY). TL;DR: Remote work is awesome! :)

Notes:
* *Web* covers the usual front-end skills, *Mobile* usually means iOS and Android, and *DevOps* is listed for companies where this is one of the main focus areas.
* Globally-competitive compensation means that the company doesn't use remote workers as a source of cheap labour. For compensation to be globally competitive, the company should offer packages that are comparable to market rates in major tech hubs.
